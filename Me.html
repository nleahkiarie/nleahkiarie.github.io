				<h3>More</h3>
				<p>I love nature and everything in it.My favorite landscape is mountains.I love cool silent places with shades and trees and grass.I love reading novels at the time i was creating this page i was reading Cindy Dees'captain's call of duty.I prefer reading novels after watching its movie as movies tend to disapoint.A lot of stuff in the novel is left out.</p>
				<p>I love playing around with colors and my favorite color is black.I love black because its easy to work with.It goes well with every other color.My other favorite color is grey its i think the only bright color i like.I don't like bright colors because they pull too much attention though anytime i'm working with bright color I add in some duul colors to break the common.Too much color ruins the work so i work with minimal color</p>
